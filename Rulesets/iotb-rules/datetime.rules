// OpenHAB rules for date and time
//
// These rules contain the code that performs status changes based on
// astronomical or calendar events, or at specific times of day.
//
// NOTE: only *status changes* are in this file; automated actions
// should NOT be included here, but in the respective rule files such as
// 'lights.rules' or 'alarm.rules'.

// Required libraries
import org.openhab.core.library.types.*

// Day's on and Night's off after sunrise
rule "Daytime"
when
	Item sSunrise_Event changed to ON
then
	postUpdate(sDay, ON)
	postUpdate(sNight, OFF)
end

// Day's off and Night's on after sunset
rule "Nighttime"
when
	Item sSunset_Event changed to ON
then
	postUpdate(sDay, OFF)
	postUpdate(sNight, ON)
end
